### Hi there 👋

My name is Milana Cap. I am a WordPress engineer at XWP and a WordPress Documentation Team rep. I also do a lot of public speaking and live coding with WP-CLI. 

If you would like to see me in your city/conference, feel free to email me at [speaking@developerka.org](mailto:speaking@developerka.org).

You can also buy me a coffee so I can keep making new talks and workshops.
